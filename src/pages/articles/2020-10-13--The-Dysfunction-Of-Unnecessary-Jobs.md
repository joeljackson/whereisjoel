Your job takes up more than half of your waking life.  You'll likely also spend more than half of your living years working. This is a commitment. If you knew you had to spend 1/4 of your life doing something that didn't matter, you'd probably be pretty disapointed. It's the first thing people ask you when they meet you. "What do you do?" Whether we mean to or not, we judge people based on their job. As an adult, to maintain our sanity, we need to believe that the thing we do professionally matters.
