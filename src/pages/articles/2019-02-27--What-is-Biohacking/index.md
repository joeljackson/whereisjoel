TLDR; Biohacking is using data to empower people to take control of their own wellness.

# Context
I recently joined [Upgrade Labs](https://upgradelabs.com) as CTO. Upgrade Labs is the world's first "Biohacking" facility. Hacking has traditionally among the public had a very negative connotation. People imagine someone sitting in a dark room surrounded by computers breaking into their government servers, or potentially their bank account. Even Google has a dubious opinion of what we do.

# So what is biohacking?
If what we're doing isn't what google claims, what is it?  
> ### Definition: _Biohacking_  
>(noun) Using self experimentation and measurable feedback to create improved wellness outcomes.
