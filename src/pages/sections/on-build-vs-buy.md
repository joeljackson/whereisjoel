# On Build vs Buy

Sneak Peak: __Mostly buy__.

Software is expensive. Like, *really* expensive. It's common for a piece of good software in your stack to cost on the order or $80,000 per year or more. 

## Does it create competitive advantage/differentiation?

If a feature is designed to create a competitive advantage for you, there's a pretty good chance that *buy* is not on the table for you. If you could buy it, your competition would have it, and it wouldn't be a competitive advantage.

> When Honest was founded there was not good subscription commerce software on the market. Honest built the subscription commerce software itself and enabled the company to grow from 0 to 300 million in revenue in under 3 years. This would never have been possible without the subscription commerce software.

Competitve advantage doesn't have to come from features that don't exist in other products on the market. Login is a table stakes feature for almost all software at this point. Slack however made an extremely simple login passwordless flow that decreased friction and increased product adoption. 

If your feature isn't creating competitive advantage it's very likely that there is a software product on the market you can integrate. The off the shelf software will know the problem space better than your team since they spend all their time thinking about it.

## The true cost of projects

Say you scope a new feature. It's going to take your team about 2 months with 2 engineers to complete the feature. A good engineer on the West Coast will probably have a total cost of about $180,000 per year. The engineers themselves will cost $30,000 to complete the project. Add to this the cost of QA, product management, and project management and your cost to build (If you can maintain your timeline, this may not be the case) is $50,000. Worse it's not uncommon for projects to dramatically exceed their scope. (If you're reading this guide hopefully this happens to you a little bit less common.) I've seen many projects that were meant to run for 2 months go on for 6. All the sudden the project cost $150,000 plus a whole lot of opportunity cost and organizational distraction.

Now you need to maintain this software. You'll need to update packages for security flaws, you'll need to maintain infrastructure, you will absolutely need to make changes to the feature. The software company can maintain it's software cheaper, because they amortize the cost of the engineering across all their customers. But, it's not just a dollar cost. It's organiaational focus. Having to focus on these changes and infrastructure will prevent you from focusing on the things that make your organization exceptional.

## The modern software ecosystem

Something new in the last few years (2018-) is that almost every piece of software you need exists off the shelf. Need auth? Auth0. Need to integrate? Zapier. Remember this when setting off on creating software.
