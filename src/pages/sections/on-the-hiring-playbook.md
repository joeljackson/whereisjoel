So what should you do? 

I think it's interesting to compare recruiting in sports to hiring in a corporation. Why? Because it's easy for mediocre technology teams to pretend that they're excellent, they don't have objective barometers. Most teams I have worked with fall somewhere between okay to pretty good but believe that they're excellent. In sports, a team that doesn't make the playoffs can't pretend it's exceptional. Moreso, hiring in sports *should* by much easier than hiring in a workplace. When considering an athlete, sport recruiters have years of film and analytics to go over and have people who are very good at evalutating talent dedicating all their time to evaluating candidates. And they still get it wrong.

So give yourself a break. If sports recruiters screw it up, how are you expected to get it right? You're adantage is that while a sporting team might need top 1% candidates to win you don't. If you could consistently fill your team with top 30%th percentile candidates and do a great job of empowering them, you'd be off to a great start. 

There are three key elements to improving your hiring process and it's outcomes. The first is improving your sourcing to bias candidates to be higher quality, the second is improving your interviewing to ensure you're more likely to filter out candidates who aren't a fit and third is improving the candidate experience to make them more likely to accept with correct expectations.

## The playbook
1. __Build from the draft:__ The value of getting good candidates out of university can't be overstated enough. They come in with expectations around roles that can be managed easily and you can teach them to work in a way that works with your organization. As a manager growing a team, you should make it a priority to reach out to local universisties and make some friends there.
2. __Work with an external recruiter:__ If pool of people actively looking for a new job isn't that great where should you turn to get great candidates? Other companies. External recruiters can provide you access to candidates outside your network in these companies. Even highly satisfied star-performers have bad days, and one message on a bad day from someone they know is all that's needed to get a conversation going that might move that person over to your team.
3. __Design a recruitment process that impresses candidates:__ There's nothing worse than finding a candidate you love and then have them reject your offer. Great interview prcesses impress great candidates. They should be fun and demonstrate that your team is full of people they want to work with.
4. __Take the chance to make sure they can read code:__ There are alot of things you might look for in a software engineer. This is the only non-negotiable. Spend a second maing sure they can work in other people's code.
5. __Make sure you're very clear with expectations:__ *Never* promise titles, organizational influence or career paths you can't follow through on. This is the most destructive thing you can do in an interview process, and if you've designed your team thoughtfully, you won't need to.
6. __Know what you're looking for:__ Don't just send team-members into interviews. Before you interview someone be clear on what you're looking for in a candidate, and how you plan on learning whether the candidate exibits those characteristics.
