So what should you do?

It's interesting to compare recruiting in sports to hiring in a corporation. Why? It's easy for mediocre technology teams to pretend that they're excellent, they don't have objective barometers. Most teams I have worked with fall somewhere between okay to pretty good but every one of them believed that they were excellent. In sports, a team that doesn't make the playoffs can't pretend it's exceptional. Moreso, hiring in sports _should_ be much easier than hiring in a workplace. When considering an athlete, sport recruiters have years of film and analytics to go over and have people who are very good at evaluating talent dedicating 100% of their time to assessing candidates. Yet they still get it wrong.

Give yourself a break. If sports recruiters screw it up, how are you expected to get it right? Your advantage is that while a sporting team might need top 1% candidates to win you don't. So if you consistently fill your team with top 30%th percentile candidates and do a great job empowering them, you'll be off to a great start.

Four critical elements will improve your hiring process. They correlate with the three variables in the equation discussed earlier. First, improve your candidate definition. Second, improve your sourcing to bias candidates to be higher quality. Third, improve your interviewing to ensure you're more likely to filter out candidates who aren't a fit. Lastly, improve the candidate experience to make them more likely to accept with correct expectations.

I'll dig into each of these aspects of hiring in the following sections.
