So what should you do? 

I like to use sports teams recruiting as an analogy for hiring. It's very easy for mediocre technology teams to pretend that they're excellent. Most teams I have worked with are somewhere between kinda not great to pretty good. Most believe that they're excellent. In sports a team that doesn't make the playoffs can't pretend it's exceptional. Moreso, hiring in sports it *should* by much easier than hiring
in a workplace. When considering an athlete, sport recruiters have years of film and analytics to go over and have people who are very good at evalutating talent dedicating all their time to evaluating candidates. And they still whiff.

So, for starters, give yourself a break. If they screw it up, how are you expected to get it right? You're adantage is you don't need the best employees in the world, you're really just looking for top 30%.

5. __Make sure you're very clear with expectations:__
