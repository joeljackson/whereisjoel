The first step in any good interview process is to define what you're looking for and gather the interview team to ensure they're aligned. This is the most commonly missed step of the interview process. It results in interviewers asking duplicative questions and worse, missing interviewing for important candidate attributes while interviewing for attributes that don't necessarily matter. The result of this process should be a list of skills and drivers you're looking for in the candidates, and an idea of who is going to be looking for what how in each interview.

In this step, you'll define the skills you're looking for, and define the type of person you think would excel in your organization. Organizations tend to focus on skillsets in interviews and under-invest in figuring out if they're hiring great employees. A candidate being good at the skill you need does not guarantee a good hire.

Spend a second identifying attributes that will make someone a strong employee outside of their core skillset. This should include their drivers, their aspirations, and their work styles. I want to examine two engineering archetypes for a second. Some engineers are driven by solving code problems and some are driven by solving user problems. I'm sure you've met both types. One will stay up until 3:00 am refactoring an excessively long class into more manageable code, and one will stay up all night building a new user feature they think will solve a significant pain point. Both may be very skilled and can be very additive to the right team, but both will also not be happy working on a team where they don't get to express their unique superpowers.

Maybe you have a team where people like to get heads down for hours at a time and solve problems; maybe you have a team where people like to sit side by side and work collaboratively. All of these things matter in a hiring process. As part of your interviews, you may discover entirely new superpowers and drivers in candidates you didn't know you wanted. That doesn't make this activity any less valuable, going into an interview without a strong candidate definition is a recipe for a poor hire.

A few of the things I often look for in software engineers include

- Intrinsic motivation - Loves building software for the sake of software
- Highly curious - Spends time learning about software engineering outside of their job
- Strong team drive - Doesn't want to let their team down and will do whatever it takes to make sure they don't
- Loves digital product - Strongly motivated by software outcomes, not just the underlying technical pieces
- Good problem solver - Great at figuring out problems outside of their core skillset

This list, of course, can change on a role-by-role basis. It's a worthwhile exercise compiling a list of the things you have personally found valuable in previous co-workers and determining if they fit a role you're currently hiring for. If they do, consider adding them to your candidate definition.

By the time you're done with this, you should have something like the following complete. Make sure to do this before any new candidate you bring in.
