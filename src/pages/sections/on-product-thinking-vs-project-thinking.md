Before anyone sits down to actually build software, digital teams are first presented with the job of figuring out what to do, and when to do it. This process usually involves the organization setting goals, a set of product managers breaking down the goals, looking for opportunities and presenting some sort of roadmap to the organization. Some variation in this activity happens in every company. How this actually plays out though can vary dramatically company but generally falls into two different types of delivery planning, **product based delivery planning** and **project based delivery planning**. Understanding both types of thinking about your digital activities and when to apply them is critical to building a successful and competitive software organization.

Let's start by thinking about our goal in building a digital product. We want to solve customer problems for which they will pay us; we call this delivering value. Ideally we deliver so much value at a low enough price that customers can't help but use the product. When some group of users exists for whom this is true, we say we've found product market fit. As we continue to add value and reduce cost (And market our product of course) we should hypothetically grow and retain that user base.

> I live in Los Angeles. In LA, due to the size of the city and poor urban planning, it's very hard to live without a car. Despite the fact that a car is expensive, it delivers enough value that most people in the city have cars. This is how you want your product to be, can't live without. You do this by making some set of features in it so valuable to some set of customers that it's indispensable.

Some astute readers are probably thinking something along the lines of "I guess that makes sense... But it's kind of a weird way to think about integrating our new accounting software last month." Good point. Maybe if you do some mental gymnastics think of your accounting team as the "user"... But really probably the most important things in your new accounting software was that it matched the spec at the end and it was delivered on time. You'll notice there is a shift in what you're looking for here, you're actually looking to maximize predictability in what was delivered and when it was delivered. This is the core difference between project thinking and product thinking, both are trying to create business value, but in different ways. One aims to create business value by maximizing customer value, the other by creating predictability of delivery.

## Project Thinking

I'll start by discussing project thinking because it's what we're most used to. Start by thinking back to a group project you worked on in university. It probably had a deadline, and if you didn't hit that deadline you either were severely penalized or took s 0. There were probably also a set of requirements that needed to be met at the end to get a good grade.

> A common computing science group undergraduate endeavor is writing a compiler. The group will be given a set of instructions that must be compiled and multiple test cases that they should use to ensure their compiler works. On the first day of the project the group knows the requirements of the project (Compile these 14 different instructions) and the deadline (You must submit your solution.) A situation with a known set of requirements and a known deadline is called a "Project".

In order to successfully deliver your project you probably started by putting together a plan that looked something like "Jenn will do A, B and C. Josh with do D, E and F. Then we'll get together and put these things together and once they're together Jenn will take on G and Josh will take on H." (Where letters could really be any task associated with the project delivery.) You may even have been asked to model the project delivery using some sort of project planning tool like a gantt chart.

Delivering software in this way makes intuitive sense. Most of us have succeeded to some extent in our lives by virtue of having a strong capability of delivering projects successfully. We see this type of delivery around us all the time as well. It's how people build house, and bridges and warehouses. Predictability in delivery is also very comforting as an organization. We like predictability and it feels safe to say things like "In six months we're going to roll out a new bundle management interface." In fact it's often necessary to have predictable delivery to support an organization. Imagine moving to a new accounting software as described above. We probably ended the contract with our old accounting software, and we need confidence that we can predictably launch to new accounting software at the time the old accounting software is turning off. We need to have confidence we can integrate with partners on timelines set out by contracts. We need to be able to predictably have software ready for big marketing pushes we have around launches. etc.

In all these scenarios the predictability of our ability to deliver on time trumps all other concerns, and project based delivery is the right way to think about delivering your software.

## Product Thinking

That sounds great, why would I not want predictable delivery? It's that predictability is bad, just that often we want to optimize for a different outcome. Recall that our customer uses our product because it delivers value. As we work on our product we should be adding to the value it's able to deliver to customers. If our goal is to do a better job of delivering value than our competitors, we want to optimize the rate that we are able to increase the value our product delivers. This is the pace of value delivery (Δv/Δt). It's easy to understand how an organization that continually delivers value at a faster pace, will end up with a better product. Before digging into why optimizing the pace of value delivery is at odds with optimizing the predictability of software delivery I want to talk a little bit about games.

When I was going to University there were two major game research departments in the computing science department at the school, the checkers research department and the poker research department. Really there wasn't a checkers department, but there was at one point and they solved the game of checkers. In checkers there is a perfect move for every possible board configuration. For black there is always a perfect move to win, and for red a perfect move to stave off inevitable defeat for as long as possible. This is possible because checkers is what's called a complete information game. We know the entire state of the world at any given time, and so we can make decisions that are provably correct with 100% confidence that they are correct. Because of this, we could lay out a strategy of provably correct moves before the game, never change the strategy and win every time. (Assuming we're red of course.)

Poker is different, it's what's called an incomplete information game. We don't know the whole state of the world, because we don't know our opponents cards. At any stage of the game, decisions we make cannot be made with 100% confidence, we have to decide how confident we are based on the cards on the table and our opponents behavior. Every decision we make in poker is a bet on the state of the world. If I get pocket aces I start out I probably start out betting that I have the best hand and raise and re-raise pre-flop. If the flop shows a suited ten, jack, queen and an opponent bets heavily on it, I may consider folding my pocket aces, because I am now betting someone else has a better hand than me. The key to successful behavior in an incomplete information scenario is rapidly revising our strategy as new information becomes available. Imagine setting a betting strategy at the beginning of a hand and not revising it when I see the flop, you'd lose a ton of money. In fact, in this scenario the best strategy may be to fold.

In product management as in poker, we are continually gathering information about the world around us. We talk to our customers, see user behavior, learn more about our competitors, meet new prospective partners and the list goes on. Every feature we build is a bet on the amount of value the feature will deliver to customers based on all the available information at that time. It's important to note that completing a feature does not automatically add value. In fact, too many ill-conceived features detract from customer value. Think of the adoption of figma vs photoshop for UX design. Sketch and figma took photoshop, the de facto standard for web design circa 2010, removed 95% of the features and created a much better product.

In a scenario where the majority of features we're delivering are bets on delivering user value, and where we're continually gathering new information, project thinking guarantees we'll be working on features that are not the highest value because the bets were taken at a point where we had less information about the world. Much like the poker player who starts with pocket aces who opted to fold, we should continuously re-evaluate our confidence in the bets we're making in order to deliver the most value. However, that re-evaluation significantly reduces the predictability of when (or even if) we'll deliver a feature. This is what makes product thinking so hard, rather than saying "in 6 months we'll deliver a new bundling system" we have to say "in 6 months we'll have maximized the value we delivered to users." We'll talk more later about how to actually implement product thinking in an organization.

## When to use project thinking or product thinking

At most large software companies, the answer isn't interesting. They have digital product teams that are innovating on customer products and they use product based thinking and delivery. They also have software service organization that do things like integrate ERP software and they use project based thinking and delivery. For smaller companies that are not explicitly software companies, that's a luxury that's normally impossible. These organizations have more "Kitchen Sink" style software teams where the teams must handle all different types of outcomes the organization needs to drive. In this case it becomes more important to be thoughtful about the type of delivery going on.

It should be clear now that both delivery strategies aren't well suited for the same sorts of tasks, so when do you use each? Let's look at some examples.

1. **I'm opening a new warehouse on January 15th, and we need our e-commerce platform and ERP connected to it.** - Project thinking. The end deliverable is well defined, the scope is easy to predict and there is an end date that is critical to hit.
2. **We have a grocery list app and we're trying to be top in the app store** - Product thinking. We don't know the most valuable thing that will make our app better than competitors.

So, what's the difference? There are three things to look at when deciding how to behave.

1. **Scope** - Can the deliverable be broken down into smaller deliverables? Imagine a project that's going to take months to get done, and unless it's fully complete it won't deliver value. The greater the scope, the more likely you should use project based delivery mechanism. This is not an excuse to take your 6 favorite features, lump them into a large scope "project" and plan for delivering them on time.
2. **Commitment** - How committed is the organization to deliver this feature? Maybe you've already invested millions of dollars in a new ERP, or there has been months of marketing push around a new feature. In these scenarios, timeliness of delivery matters more than pace of value delivery and you should use a project based delivery mechanism.
3. **Confidence** - How confident are we the feature we're building will deliver value? If this is less than 100% (And in most cases it should be) we should favor product based delivery. What do I mean by confidence? Say we're integrating Salesforce CRM to SAP ERP, we certainly need something that lives in the middle and translates domain objects between the two systems. I'm 100% confident that feature will deliver the required value. On the other hand if I'm operating a wellness facility I may want a customer dashboard that shows the customer what time their upcoming appointments are. I suspect this will deliver customer value, but I can't be 100% confident it's something my customers want.

It's very likely that your organization will need to operate in both ways. We'll dig more into how to implement strategies to do this later on.

## Can I use product thinking outside of digital product?

Yes, reading this you may have noted that the circumstances under which product thinking is effective exist in other places in your organization. For example, product based thinking can be particularly effective in marketing. The landscape is always changing and we don't know what initiatives are going to work. Like digital product, we like to think of our marketing spend as predictable and plannable, but if we plan too far out we ignore emergent opportunities and things we learned from previous initiatives. If this resonates, you can also use all the management tactics described here to drive your marketing and growth behaviors.
