The problem with hiring starts with the fact that it's very hard.

There's an underlying economic reason for this. The hiring pool is filled with underperformers. Why? Firstly because orgs are unlikely to let go of their star performers unless they absolutely have to. Star performers are also much more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. They climb the ranks quickly, carry high levels of organizational influence and are usually working on things that create impact in their organization. What this means is that the candidate pool is full of people who are looking for a new job (likely not top performers) or people companies had to let go (also likely not top performers).

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that interviewing is an unreliable process. Think of the times your team has all said a candidate was great, and they turned out to be at best mediocre, occasionally terrible. Pairing a large number of underperformers in the candidate pool and an unreliable interview process is a recipe for creating a mediocre team. Let's look at some numbers.

## The Numbers
An okay interviewing process may weed out 1/3 of bottom 50% candidates. Assume the cadidate pool contains around 90% bottom 50% candidates. This means 65% of your hires are going to be bottom 50% candidates, that's not great. Worse yet 70% of the candidate pool may be bottom 10% candidates and a normal interview process may filter 60% of them. 30% of your hires, or rather 1/3 are going to be bottom 10% candidates.

So, that should make it clear that a haphazard interview and hiring preocess isn't good enough. And worse a team that is consistently hiring (read scaling) is very likely to fill the team up with mediocre employees.
