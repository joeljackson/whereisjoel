The problem with hiring starts with the fact that it's much harder than we acknowledge.

There's an underlying economic reason for this. The hiring pool is filled with underperformers. Why? Orgs are unlikely to let go of their star performers unless they have to. Star performers are also much more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. They climb the ranks quickly, carry high levels of organizational influence, and are usually working on things that impact their organization. The pool of people actively looking for a new job doesn't contain top-tier employees.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that interviewing is an unreliable process. Think of the times your team has all said a candidate was great, and they turned out to be at best mediocre, occasionally terrible. Pairing a large number of underperformers in the candidate pool and an unreliable interview process is a recipe for creating a mediocre team. Let's look at some numbers.

## The Numbers

Let's start by defining the likelihood that a hire is either destructive or creates a competitive advantage.

There are 4 variables to consider

**C - The confidence that you're hiring the correct role, and that you've defined the characteristics correctly.** It's very easy to think you need a role you don't or to just not be right about the skillset needed to fill a role.

**P - The percent of the candidate pool that matches the criteria you're searching for**

**I - The likelihood your interview process will filter out an unsuitable candidate**

The chance of a candidate not working out is `1 - (C * (1-((1-P) * (1-I)))`.

So, let's say a destructive employee is bottom 20th percentile. The likelihood of hiring a destructive candidate in an average interview process might look something like this C - 70%, P - 25% and I - 60%. That leaves us with a roughly 50% chance of hiring a destructive candidate. Yikes! Now imagine rapidly growing your team; you very quickly fill your company with bottom quartile employees.
