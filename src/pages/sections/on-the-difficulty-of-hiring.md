The problem with hiring starts with the fact that it's very hard.

There's an underlying economic reason for this. The hiring pool is filled with underperformers. Why? Firstly because orgs are unlikely to let go of their star performers unless they absolutely have to. Star performers are also much more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. They climb the ranks quickly, carry high levels of organizational influence and are usually working on things that create impact in their organization. This means, they're much liklier to be satisfied with their current jobs.

## The Numbers
Add to this the fact that interviewing is an unreliable process. Think of the times your group has all given a candidate two thmbs up, and they turned out to be at best mediocre, occasionally terrible. An okay interviewing process may weed out 30% of the bottom 50% of candidates. Then consider that the cadidate pool contains maybe 95% bottom 50% candidates. 65% of your hires are going to be bottom 50% candidates, that's not great. Worse yet 70% of the candidate pool may be bottom 10% and a normal interview process may filter 60% of them. 30% of your hires, or rather 1/3 are going to be bottom 10% candidates.

So, that should make it clear that a normal interview preocess isn't good enough. And worse a team that is consistently hiring (read scaling) is very likely to fill the team up with mediocre players.
