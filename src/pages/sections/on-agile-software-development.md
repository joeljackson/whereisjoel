## Agile Software Engineering

If you talk to a person on any software team about how they behave they'll probably tell you they do "Agile Software Development". Almost all of them probably do sprints, have sprint planning and use an agile board, most assign points to tickets, and some probably have grooming meetings. You'll note that this hasn't made every single software team exceptional. Why? The rituals of "agile software engineering" do not in and of themselves make teams good. Agile rituals without the core essence of agile can actually make teams worse. 

Having said that, the core elements at the center of agile can help make your team better. I'm not going to go through a deep description of agile software engineering here. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_values) can do that for you. 

### Key features of agile development

* __Limits on work.__ Either the amount you're working on in a period or the amount of work you're working on at once. 
* __Teams that are self sufficient to solve problems.__ When presented a problem to solve, a team should not be blocked by work required outside the team. 
* __Frequent product delivery.__ Teams integrate quickly

## What this accomplishes

### It Encourages Solving Problems

Frequent delivery encourages solving problems. First, each iteration should hypothetically solve some sort of business problem. Otherwise what was the point of the iteration? Yhe team may as well have stayed home. Second, it surfaces problems faster. It's impossible to know how customers will use software without giving it to them. Lastly empowering the team to solve problems allows for more discusion around problem resolution

### Focus

One of the magical things about agile is it encourages teams to focus. There's nothing that destroys a team's ability to execute like not focusing. Whether it's context switching, resource contention or other, teams working on too many things at once 

### Self Sufficiency

As orgranizations grow, organizing the organization becomes harder. It's hard when a few people on a team don't have the same priority, two teams with different priorities, forget about it. Even just identifying a simple project requires two teams is a reason to add an extra sprint.


### Why agile works

It can be hard to say. But, when teams are doing it, it seems to work. If I had to guess here are a few things I think are at root.
* __It empowers smart people to solve problems.__ Most really capable people I know are great problem solvers. Great problem solvers are just not motivated by implementing someone else's problem solution. I actually think this may be the single most impactful outcome created by an effective agile process. Think about it yourself. When you've worked on a project you were excited about you've probably knocked it out of the park. When you work on a project you don't care about the quality at the end is worse, and it probably take 6x as long or more.
* __It reduces risk through frequent delivery.__ One of your largest software risks is building the wrong thing. Not only is the cost high, the opportunity cost can be insurmountable for early organizations or for organizations that are tight margin. By delivering software frequently you can know and not theorize as to how it's going to impact it's target customer.
* __It reduces risk through delaying decision making.__ Many of the most most interesting choices I've ever made were not initially obviousÂ and maybe didn't even seem available at the beginning of a project. By conitnuously re-evaluating rather than having a pre-defined project plan we can take advantage of emergent opportunities.

### Do I have to "agile"?
It's blasphemy in the world of modern software engineering to not "agile". This means that everyone says they're doing agile software development. You don't have to agile. Say it with me. "I don't have to agile". Many organizations that call themselves agile actually miss every single key feature of agile. Don't do this, pretending to be agile won't make you more effective. If you want a group of product managers to solve problems and spoonfeed an engineering team, you can do that. You'll even need cheaper engineers.
