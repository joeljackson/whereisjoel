This is not meant to be a comprehensive dive into every piece of running your software enabled business. Most sections in this work have entire books written about how to do them well. I'll share a few here that I've found particularly helpful in thinking about digital product delivery and management.

1. Thinking In Bets - Annie Duke
2. Drive - Daniel Pink
3. Clean Code - Robert C Martin
4. Team Topologies - Manual Pais
5. First Break All The Rules - Marcus Buckingham
