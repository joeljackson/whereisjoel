I'm dedicating the first section to hiring. Why? For starters, you'll probably find hiring difficult if you're not running a cool software company. Beyond this, bad hires are very destructive to your organization. Even good hires brought onboard with wrong expectations can be exceptionally damaging. Every good team starts with great hires and a great hiring process. I believe so strongly in the importance of hiring that when I'm talking about implementing healthy team behavior, managing backlogs, etc. I often start with a quick discussion of hiring practices.

Let's try an exercise. Think of the organizational problems you've had in the past in your career. Now try to find the ones that don't relate to a bad hire or hiring process. I'd bet there are few. Maybe the team member didn't have a core skill required to be effective, which was disruptive. More likely, the team member's viewpoint on how to work didn't align with your organization's, their core drivers didn't mesh with the organizational structure, or worse, they came into the organization with incorrect expectations. If someone comes in thinking they're going to manage a large chunk of the company, and there is no realistic path for that, it will create dysfunction.

Hiring is often an afterthought in organizations. Bring candidates in, put them in a room with several top performers, don't talk about it before, huddle after. If most people say yes, you tell the candidate whatever story you think will get them on board. If this sounds familiar, don't be surprised if your results aren't exceptional. This section should be helpful.

### TLDR;

Hire smart people, who have a set of skills you need and who like exercising those skills. The single greatest screener for employees is whether they love the thing they will be working on. The revolution of creative work gives people the ability to do something they love as a job. Every piece of your digital delivery is something people already do without being paid. People love building software, love designing things and love thinking about improving digital products.
