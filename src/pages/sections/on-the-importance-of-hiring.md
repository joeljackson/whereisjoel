I'm dedicating the entire first section, and 1/3 of this work, to hiring. Why? For starters, if you're not running a cool software company you'll probably find hiring pretty hard. Beyond this, bad hires are very destructive to your organization. Even good hires brought onboard with bad expectations can be exceptionally destructive. Every good team starts with great hires and a great hiring process.

Look at your organizational problems. I'd be willing to bet a good number of them can be traced back to a bad hire. Maybe the team member doesn't have a core skill required to be effective and that's disruptive. More likely the team member's viewpoint on how to work doesn't align with your organization's, their core drivers don't mesh with the organizational structure, or worse they came into the organization with incorrect expercations. If someone comes in thinking they're going to potentially manage a large chunk of the company, and there is no realistic path for that, you're going to have a problem.

Hiring is often an afterthought in organizations. You bring some candidates in, put them in a room with a few of your top performers, don't talk much about it before and have a huddle after. Then if most people say yes, you tell the candidate whatever you think you need to tell them to get them onboard. If this is what you're doing, you shouldn't be surprised that your results aren't exceptional, and this section should be helpful.
