Effective software teams enable effective companies. There is no scaled company on the planet that doesn't employ some degree of software engineering, whether it's interacting with consumers, understanding data or enabling behaviors.

1. **Software teams can create competitive advantage**. Any behavior your organization wants to deliver at scale requires software. For example, if you're advertising at scale on the internet you are likely using facebook business manage and google ads. What if you want your organization to do something at scale a competitor can not do? You definitionally need to write software. If you are able to buy software that enables this behavior, you competitor can too and your organization is not doing anything at scale your competitor can't.

   > **EG** The Honest Company was started in 2011 and at the time subscription commerce wasn't something you could buy off the shelf on the internet. Honest build custom subscription commerce software and was able to rapidly dominate a market that lent itself particularly well to replenished orders, diapers. Being the only player in the space with an auto-replenishment feature gave the company a significant competitive advantage over similar companies.

2. **Software is very expensive**. A minimal team of 3 engineers, a product designer and a product manager will cost $550,000 per year. Once you have software running a team that size can spend all it's time maintaining that software, which will not add any additional business value. YouBy committing to hiring a team and paying them to build a piece of software you've committed to a $550,000 yearly software subscription.

3. **Software is additive**. Good software makes it easier to change. Bad software is harder to change. Both of situations will continually reenforce themselves. Software teams working on easy to change software will find it easy to hit deadlines giving them extra space to worry about software quality. Software teams working on poor quality software will be perpetually scrambling to hit deadlines, think less about quality and their software will get worse and gradually harder to change. The end result of bad software without any intervention will be that the project needs to be scrapped and re-written. The end result of excellent software will be continuous addition of business value until the software lives it's useful life.

4. **The cost of bad software is invisible**. All your scalable behaviors are enabled by software. Bad software scales bad behaviors and good software scales good behaviors. Your business is nothing but a sum of behaviors. What do I mean?

   > Imagine a company that sells scrubs. There are several core behaviors that happen, the company orders scrubs, the company markets scrubs and the company reports on it's performance. The company is a group of people coming together to do these things and if they stopped exhibiting these behaviors the company would cease to exist. The quality of these behaviors entirely drives the outcomes the company is able to achieve.

   Bad software will create bad behaviors. Imagine there is no error checking in the software the company uses to order scrubs. The company will either make more errors in their orders and not have a stable supply chain or they will spend more time double checking all their orders and have less time available for strategic work like maybe lowering the cost of their supply chain. Over an organization the sum of small inefficiencies created by software can easily go unnoticed all while silently choking that organization's ability to be competitive. Conversly, organizations with high quality software are enabled to have more effective behaviors and are subsequently more likely to outperform.
