1. **Build from the draft:** The value of getting good candidates out of university can't be overstated enough. They come in with expectations around roles that can be managed easily and you can teach them to work in a way that works with your organization. As a manager growing a team, you should make it a priority to reach out to local universisties and make some friends there.
2. **Work with an external recruiter:** If pool of people actively looking for a new job isn't that great where should you turn to get great candidates? Other companies. External recruiters can provide you access to candidates outside your network in these companies. Even highly satisfied star-performers have bad days, and one message on a bad day from someone they know is all that's needed to get a conversation going that might move that person over to your team.
3. **Design a recruitment process that impresses candidates:** There's nothing worse than finding a candidate you love and then have them reject your offer. Great interview prcesses impress great candidates. They should be fun and demonstrate that your team is full of people they want to work with.
4. **If they're a software engineer, take the opportunity to make sure they can read code:** There are alot of things you might look for in a software engineer. This is the only non-negotiable. Spend a second making sure they can work in other people's code. The easiest way I've found to do this, is have them solve a simple bug in your software. You'll be amazed by the difference in how quickly top performers and poor performers are able to negotiate a codebase and find the source of a problem.
5. **Make sure you're very clear with expectations:** _Never_ promise titles, organizational influence or career paths you can't follow through on. This is the most destructive thing you can do in an interview process, and if you've designed your team thoughtfully, you won't need to.
6. **Know what you're looking for:** Don't just send team-members into interviews. Before you interview someone, be clear on what you're looking for in a candidate, and how you plan on learning whether the candidate exibits those characteristics.
