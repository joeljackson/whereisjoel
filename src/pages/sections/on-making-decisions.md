## The two activities of an organization

Everything your organization does falls into the category of "Making Decisions" or "Executing on Decisions". The focus of organizations often strays to improving decision execution, while failing address decision making. First we'll examine a few of the negative organizational byproducts of poorly executed decision making, then we'll look at some of the reasons that organizations fail to do a good job of decision making; finally we'll talk about what to do to make decision making better.

## Why is decision making important?

Your organization is a sum of decisions you've made. Probably some of them were good, probably some of them were not. It should be obvious that if we're able to bias the decisions towards good decisions the organization will be better off. What we don't realize id the infrastructure around making decisions will not just impact the quality of decisions, but also the happiness of employees through the decision making process. Almost every real decision that needs to be made will lead to some sort of employee disagreement, and a good process around making the decisions will make those disagreements much easier to handle.

## How to know if you have a problem with decision making

Every organization I have ever talked to has an issue some issue with making decisions. Decision making problems in organizations are easy to spot, but are rarely acknowledged because no one looks for them. If any of the following applies to your organization you probably have an issue with decision making that you need to address.

1. **Members of the organization frequently complain about decision making.**

   This might sound obvious. People are complaining about decision making, so we have a decision making problem, right? As a leader, you can be completely oblivious to this unless you actually look, because the symptoms are hidden from organizational leaders. The way this manifests is people standing around in the kitchen will say things like

   > No one ever asked me about whether we were going to launch ads that

2. **"Decisions" are not followed through on**

   Decisions made through a broken decision making process

3. **Members of the organization complain that other's are "in their lane"**

   No matter what you do this will occasionally come up in your teams. This manifests as people saying things like

   > I'm the director of data science, and the the database schema for this project is terrible. No one talked to me about it and it should be my call.

   Having "Lanes" should be the first red flag for you. An organization that understands decision making doesn't need to be nearly as black and white in terms of who owns what. There's no reason the director of data science mentioned above should have to be the person who decides on the database schema for a project. In fact, this project may not be the director of data science's main priority and required them to make the decision will slow down the project. Rather than making sure that everyone stays in their lane, we solve this problem by following good decision making behavior.

## How to make decisions

1. **Identify that you're making a decision**

   Decisions in organizations are, sometimes, obvious. For example "Are we going to change from a homegrown software platform onto a turnkey software platform?" or "Are we going to use SQS or RabbitMQ for our queueing system?" Often, however, a decision being made slips through the cracks. Take for example a marketing team

2. **Identify a person to make the decision**

   For every decision identify someone in the organization to make the decision. Groups are not well suited to making decisions. It can be scary to surrender control over meaningful organizational choices you care about. Remember that you've hired people because you trust them and they're good at their job! More importantly, you may not be the best person in the organization to make the choice. Front lines employees usually have more information and by being closer to the actual problem are better able to understand constraints.

   How do you identify the correct decision maker? Ideally you want an employee as close to the problem as possible, but with enough organizational influence that people will buy into a choice they've made.

   > > Imagine a company that manages software architecture. Say Heroku. The founder/CEO is likely and excellent software architect and probably very good at devops. The organization will of course also have devops problems and need to make decisions on them. Despite their apparent skillset, the organization's CEO is not the right choice to make decisions on the devops problems.

3) **Make sure the person making the decision understands their framework and constraints**

   > > Let's talk again about the Software Architecture organization. The CEO is an exceptional architect, but the CEO is not the most appropriate decision maker. It would be unwise to ignore the CEO's experience. There is a good chance that the company's CEO has a direction they want the team to move in. For example maybe the CEO

4) **Have the person making the decision identify and talk with all key stakeholders**

   You've identified the decision maker and given them a set of constraints. We need to acknowledge that no one in the organization has the full picture and that there are probably more stakeholders in the organization that care about the outcome of the decision. Your decision maker needs to talk to each stakeholder to understand their opinion and the reasons behind the opinion. The decision maker listening to each stakeholder should not only enable them to make a better decision, it will allow them to address any concerns the stakeholders will have if the decision does not go that stakeholder's way.

5) **Make the decision**

   You've identified a decision-maker, you've made sure they understand the constraints, and they've talked to all the key stakeholders. Let them make the decision. This is why you hire people you trust who are good at their job. Be thoughtful about it, but unless it's a disaster of a decision, go with it. Remember, they know more about this than you do, even if that's hard to accept.

6) **Communicate with all key stakeholders what the decision is and why the decision was made**

   The decision, now made, needs to be communicated out. If you've built a diverse organization not everyone will agree with the decision that has been made. This results in problems at organizations that have not followed an effective decision making process. If you've done everything right up to here, you'll be fine. Everyone understands who's decision it was to make and the framework within which the decision was made. Now you need to communicate to each stakeholder what the decision was and as importantly why it was made.

   > > Back to the "Heroku-ish" organization. Let's imagine that an engineer wants to make significant change to the infrastructure. Say
