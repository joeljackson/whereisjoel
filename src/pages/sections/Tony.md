Tony,

We’re always grateful for the feedback. Of course, you're always encouraged to keep sending any our way.

Before digging into Matt’s feedback, I want to emphasize the difference between the two businesses.

Our core business is making health optimization easy by acting as an operating system for our customer's health choices. Ideally, we want all of our customers to be on Lifeforce-designed programs guiding them to their best health, and the first step is to purchase the Lifeforce diagnostic. We've worked hard to design an experience that funnels customers interested in guided health optimization to buy the diagnostic. Maximizing customers who are fully using Lifeforce can create outsized health outcomes, driving significant enterprise value for Lifeforce.

Conversely, Do Not Age is primarily a supplement business meaning they want to encourage customers to explore their products and ideally purchase one.

For Matt's feedback, we agree with it all. I'll walk you through a few of the changes we're making to improve our site and when they'll be live.

The most significant change we're making is "guided nutraceutical buying". Customers can fill out an assessment and receive a custom plan based on their individual results. This will be launching in Q4.

On Matt's specific feedback

1. Customer's first interaction - Matt's instinct here is right. The user's first click is most often on "products". Matt noted here that the number of options "Might stress him out a little bit." I couldn't agree more, there is too much to do in the menu. We're working on a new design to launch this quarter.

2. Product pages - Matt points out there "being way too much on the page" and that he wouldn't read it all. We want to offer a page that works for "Matt's" and well-informed buyers. The top portion of the page should give enough detail for most people, and the rest of the page offers an opportunity to dig into the product for anyone interested. We're working on changing the product descriptions to be more scannable, focus more on benefits and communicate how unique our products are. These changes will be completed this quarter.

3. Membership - Great feedback that we need more details on what the membership is at the top of the page.

4. "All I want is to understand what Tim takes" - Agree that this is a pretty effective way to merchandize.
