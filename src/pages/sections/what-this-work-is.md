This is a collection of my thoughts on helping to enable effective software engineering teams. Some of it is backed by research, some is from conversations with a myriad of wonderful people I very much respect, some is from experience. If you've landed here in some way this is probably a subject that matters to you.

Software Engineering plays a role in almost every modern corporation. This is demonstrated in the fact that there are [4.4 million](https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/number-software-developers-world) software engineers in the United States. That's about 1 in every 30 working people in the country. I'm specifically writing this for those working in Software Engineering at companies that are "Software Enabled Companies". What do I mean by this?

## What is a "Software Company"

I often here engineers flippantly throw around the quote that all modern companies are Software Companies. All modern companies are software enabled companies, but all modern companies are not software companies and the distinction is important.

### _Software Company_

1. The product you sell is your software
1. Selling more product has a theoretically 100% gross margin
1. Your product scales infinitely enabling easy effective monopolies

### _Software Enabled Company_

1. Literally every other company. (Aside from mom + pop companies that don't yet need any software)

Let's examine this for a second.

#### Google

Google is a company that produces alot of software. Are they a software company? **Yes**. Why? The product they sell is software that distributes of ads. To distribute another ad, someone else makes the ad, puts it on their platform and then the theoretical incremental cost to distribute the ad is 0, making the theoretical gross margin 100%. To scale their revenue, they don't need to do anything. They could all sleep in, not go to work, and the product would scale by virtue of customers signing up and creating more ads.

#### Tesla

Tesla is another company that produces alot of software. Are they a software company? **No**. What!? They produce the software that powers their cars, right? Right. But someone else could also produce the software that powers their cars and it would take nothing away from Tesla, in fact it might even lower their costs. They make money by selling cars, not software. Each car they sell has a defined margin and they can only scale by building larger factories. If they all went home and slept their car manufacturing capacity would at best stay the same.

## Why is the distinction important?

Building good software at a "Software Enabled Company" is a much harder problem than building good software at a Software Company. The near 100% margin at the Software company is able to paper over many mistakes and enables behaviors that would never make sense at a Software Enabled Company simply because it doesn't make sense to allocate as much of the companies gross revenue to software.

1. Companies like Microsoft and Amazon can afford dead projects. Dead projects that eat 5% of their gross revenue also eat 5% of their hypothetical margin. Mistakes to be sure, but not life and death mistakes. At a company that say makes products and has a 30% gross margin, a project that eats 5% of their gross revenue would erase over 15% of their gross margin, which might make the difference between making and losing money.
1. Software Companies can experiment with technology. Something like React Native could only have happened at a software company which means that Software Companies are not constrained by existing toolsets.
1. Software Companies have much easier access to talent. They can afford to spend more time doing things like blogging which improves their external perception and makes hiring significantly easier.
1. Software Companies don't have to worry about obsolescence of their software. Airbnb will not ever be deprecated by Airbnb, it's the product they sell. If however you are Tesla and you make auto-pilot software, there is probably a company out there looking to make auto-pilot software and sell it to all the car companies. Their economics makes much more sense than yours, they can build once, sell thirty times making the cost of the software on a per customer basis 1/30 Tesla's cost. Tesla's auto-pilot engineers should not count on the auto-pilot software product continuing to exist forever.

All of these factors conspire to make building software at Software Enabled Companies require significantly more rigor and discipline than building software at a Software Company. Add to this the fact that the internet is littered with resources from companies like Airbnb advocating a set of behaviors that works for Software Companies. It can be hard to decide on the right tactics and strategies to manage your team and drive your company's success. For anyone in this situation I hope you find this a useful resource.
