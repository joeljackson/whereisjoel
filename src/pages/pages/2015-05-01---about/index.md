My name is Joel. (As you can see from my site)

I am a Software Engineer. More specifically I'm an Engineering Manager. I've spent my life bringing ideas to life through Software, and helping teams of people collaborate to bring those ideas to life faster.

My passion is for projects that can make real change and impact in the world, primarily in the field of health and environmental impact (Better yet, both). If anyone wants to talk about anything along those lines please don't hesitate to reach out.
