My name is Joel.

I get up every day and bike to a company called Upgrade Labs. Upgrade Labs is the world's first biohacking facility. We as a technology team at Upgrade Labs are building the world's first biohacking platform. What's biohacking? [Glad you asked](/posts/what-is-biohacking/).

I am a Software Engineer. I've spent my life bringing ideas to life through Software, and helping teams of people collaborate to bring those ideas to life faster.

My passion is for projects that can make real change and impact in the world, primarily in the field of health and environmental impact (Better yet, both). If anyone wants to talk about anything along those lines please don't hesitate to reach out.
